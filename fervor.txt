And just like that, the fervor died.

What once tasted like electricity was now a calm, stagnant film that enguled any fresh air.


-------------------------------------------

I clutch my coat close to my body
I'm not sure if I'm keeping things out
or if I'm afraid of letting things in

unsure of everything, i do not button it up
but i grasp the fabric so tight, my knuckles turn white.




----------------------
you'd think the saltwater streams down my cheeks
are the result of 
a broken heart
sticks or stones
maybe words that hurt me

but here's a secret
come closer

--i'm growing.
